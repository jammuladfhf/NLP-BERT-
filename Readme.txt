This Project contains the Multi-Target Classification and Sentiment analysis models.

Approach:
  Method 1: NLP sentiment analysis model1.ipynb
    Classification : 
      1. Train Test Split 
      2. Pre Processing
      3. Build Word Clouds for Pre Processing optimization.
      4. Used Phraser for N-grams for efficient results.
      5. Experimented with TF-IDF, Word2Vec.
      6. Experimented with Multiple Machine Learning Models (Logistic, Na√Øve, Random Forest) along with Grid Search for best Parameters.

    Sentiment Analysis:
      1. Used Vader Package which is basically a rule-based approach for Sentiment analysis.
      2. I applied a custom Vader Dictionary according to our Business Requirements.

 Method 2: BERT_Implimentation_Sentiment.ipynb
   Sentiment Analysis:
    1. Utilized Bert for Sentiment Analysis which is a pre-trained model.
    2. Prepared the data according to the requirements of BERT.
