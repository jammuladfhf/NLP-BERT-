#This Project contains the Multi Target Classificationa and Sentiment analysis models.

Approach:
  Method 1: NLP sentiment analysis model1.ipynb
    Classification : 
      1. Train Test Split 
      2. Pre Processing
      3. Build Word Clouds for Pre Processing optimization.
      4. Used Phraser for N-grams for efficiant results.
      5. Experimented with TF-IDF, Word2Vec.
      6. Experimented Multiple Machine Learning Models (Logistic, Naive, Random Forest) along with Grid Search for best Parameters.

    Sentiment Analysis:
      1. Used Vader Package which is basically a rule based approcah for Sentiment anlaysis.
      2. I applied custom Vader Dictionary according to our Bussiness Requirements.

 Method 2: BERT_Implimentation_Sentiment.ipynb
   Sentiment Analysis:
    1. Utilized Bert for Sentiment Analysis which is pretrained model.
    2. Prepared the data according to the reuirements of BERT.
